# uHost - Front-end Website Project

![uHost](uHost.png)

This is a front-end project created as part of the **CSS - The Complete Guide 2020** course on Udemy by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller. The purpose of this project is to enhance my front-end development skills through practical implementation.

## Description

During this course, I built the front-end (no backend) of a fictional web hosting company. Some key features of the project include:

- A starting screen with different sections
- Responsive design with an animated side-drawer
- Use of modals and forms
- Implementation of CSS animations, font styles, and more

This project has provided valuable hands-on experience and has helped me further develop my skills in CSS, including Flexbox, Grid, and Sass.
